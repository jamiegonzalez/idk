## Getting started
We assume that Matlab is installed, that EEGLAB is installed and in the Matlab path, and that ERPLAB is correctly installed in the EEGLAB plugin subfolder. If not, see the [installation instructions here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Installation).

### Run Matlab, and enter `eeglab` in the Matlab Command Window.

You should see something close to these screenshots. :

A new window appears for EEGLAB, with the ERPLAB menu:

If you encounter an error here, check that ERPLAB is installed correctly, and the troubleshooting hints.
