Here we show more information about the Data Quality measures in ERPLAB.

## The ERP.dataquality structure
By default, the ERP Averager produced an ERP dataset with 3 dataquality measures. They are saved in the Matlab structure *ERP.dataquality* - ERP.dataquality(1), ERP.dataquality(2), and ERP.dataquality(3).

They have the fields of 
*  **type** (string)
* **times** (tw x 2 array, start times, end times, where tw is the number of time windows)
* **data** (electrodes x tw x bin)
* time_window_labels (optional cell array of strings, length of tw), and 
* comments (optional string).

### Code access examples
To access the name of the 3rd data quality measure in the current ERP, enter:

`ERP.dataquality(3).type`

`ans = aSME`

To access the aSME data quality at the 1st electrode, 2nd time-window, and the 3rd bin:

`ERP.dataquality(3).data(1,2,3)`

For more dataquality scripting examples, see [the SME Matlab demos on the Open Science Foundation](https://osf.io/a4huc/).
