# ERPLAB Toolbox

A free, open-source Matlab package for analyzing ERP data.  ERPLAB extends [EEGLAB's](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) capabilities to provide robust, industrial-strength tools for ERP processing, visualization, and analysis.  ERPLAB's graphical user interface makes it easy for beginners to learn, and Matlab scripting provides enormous power for intermediate and advanced users.
