# Getting started
We assume that Matlab is installed, that EEGLAB is installed and in the Matlab path, and that ERPLAB is correctly installed in the EEGLAB plugin subfolder. If not, see the [installation instructions here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Installation).

## Download example EEG data set

Download the [example EEG data files here](https://ucdavis.box.com/shared/static/f1go6b880w82cle1l53pucvsymcbp4st.zip). Unzip to a known folder, here we show `C:\m\eegdata\erplab_tut`. Note that there is a subfolder for each experiment subject, S1 to S6.

![Tut_data_folder2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/83183516-c49b9000-a0dc-11ea-89d0-64834b883ade.png)

Within the `S1` subfolder, you the `S1_EEG.set` file. This file contains the continuous EEG data for subject 1 in EEGLAB format, and also includes some meta data, like the event code timing information.


### Run Matlab, and enter `eeglab` in the Matlab Command Window.

You should see something close to these screenshots. :

A new window appears for EEGLAB, with the ERPLAB menu:

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/82972482-010aa700-9f8a-11ea-8290-0231c5d1abb9.png">

style="cursor:pointer;"
     title="Matlab_env_with_ERPLAB - click for bigger image">
</a>

If you encounter an error here, check that ERPLAB is installed correctly, and the troubleshooting hints.


## Load EEG data in to EEGLAB

With EEGLAB started within Matlab, hit `File > Load existing dataset`.

![Load_EEGset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/83186512-7a68dd80-a0e1-11ea-95f3-5de5f7a20377.png)

Select the `S1_EEG.set` file, from the `S1` subfolder in the path you unzipped example EEG data to.

The EEGLAB window should now update to show some information about this loaded EEG set:
![S1_loaded_dataset_list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/83187297-cd8f6000-a0e2-11ea-8c2e-93f942020cde.png)

Also, a list of currently loaded EEG sets is shown in the EEGLAB window as a dropdown menu, now containing `Dataset 1: S1_EEG`. There is also dropdown menu for `ERPsets`, and this remains empty, as we have only loaded continuous EEG data.



## Get to know your EEG data
There are several aspects to the EEG datasets that are good to keep in mind. As these can be observed and verified here, it is good practice to do so at this stage:

* What data do I have? How many EEG channels? What is the duration of the recording?

This can be found within the blue EEGLAB GUI (as shown in screenshots above), where the channels per frame tells you the number of channels. The number of epochs is 1, the epoch start time is 0, and the epoch end time is 2139 s, indicating that the loaded and currently selected EEG set is continuous data, and runs from t=0 s to t=2139 s, giving (2139/60) around a 35 minute recording. This is EEG data recorded at a sample rate of 500 Hz, so there are (2139 * 500) around 1,069,500 datapoints for each electrode. 

This information can also be accessed programatically within Matlab, with commands like: 
`EEG.nbchan` `size(EEG.data)` `EEG.srate`


* What events occur within this recording? Are there event codes (aka event markers, triggers) indicating the relevant times of stimuli presentation and response?

From the EEGLAB window, we can plot the EEG recording data, through `Plot menu -> Channel data (scroll)`.

![Plot_EEG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/83189862-68d60480-a0e6-11ea-8c72-a2bf996ea5e2.png)

Channel data is presented with one channel atop another, with channel F3 on top here. If you advance the time from 0 s to 10 s, you can observe two large deflections of more that 50 ÂµV that occur at around 10.5 s and 12 s. These are likely blinks.

![Plot_EEG_scroll](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/83190634-953e5080-a0e7-11ea-86c5-541fdd16bd59.png)

Additionally, there are straight vertical dashed lines, of different colors. There are none of these in the first 12 seconds of this recording, and 4 in the trace shown above, at around 13.1, 13.6, 14.3, and 14.8 seconds. These are the event codes, indicating an event of type 22, 9, 12, 9 occurred at the respective times.

These event codes have been generated by the experimental stimuli script at the time of recording the EEG, and included with the EEG data. The 22 indicates the presentation of a certain type of frequently shown stimulus, the 12 indicates a certain type of rarely shown stimulus, and 9 indicates the time at which the subject made a buttonpress response. Here, we wish to observe that this data exists, and agrees with our expectations of this experiment.

This information can also be accessed programatically within Matlab, with commands like: 
`pop_squeezevents(EEG)`

![Count_events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/83191773-6e811980-a0e9-11ea-9ad8-54ce484dc510.png)



* What ERPs are desired? What timeframe is desired to show these ERPs?

Your research question will determine what the ERP and timeframes that are central for your experiment. Hopefully, your experimental design captures this ERP component well. There exists guides to help, like the [Oxford Handbook of ERPs](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195374148.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195374148) for example.


Now that we have loaded and examined some data, the next step is to attach an EventList:

<TABLE>
   <TR>

     <TH>Completed?</TH>

# Events and the Eventlist

At the moment, this dataset is continuous EEG data, with event markers indicating the times of trial-relevant stimulus presentation.

In order to turn this data into an Averaged ERP dataset, we need to keep track of these events in an ERPLAB format EventList, and then determine what events should go in what bin of the ERP.

Here, we wish to group the Frequent stimuli type together in one bin, and the Rare stimuli type in another, to show the difference in their averages in a P300 ERP. For more information about the experiment, [see here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Brief-Description-of-the-Example-Experiment:-Tutorial).

The EventList is a refactoring of the trial information in a more ERPLAB-interpretable way, so we can address these events later on.

The current stimulus event codes (as seen with `pop_squeezevents(EEG)`) is:


    Event Code	  Category      Probability     Correct Response
    11	          Letter        Frequent        Left Hand
    21	          Digit         Rare            Right Hand
    112	          Letter        Rare            Left Hand
    122	          Digit         Frequent        Right Hand
    12	          Letter        Rare            Right Hand
    22	          Digit         Frequent        Left Hand
    111	          Letter        Frequent        Right Hand
    121	          Digit         Rare            Left Hand
 

### Creating an Eventlist
To create an EventList for the EEG data we loaded above, let's hit <br>
`ERPLAB menu > EventList > Create EEG EVENTLIST`


![Create_EL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/84070306-c6890d00-a980-11ea-93c5-85a6090aa7de.png)

That will pop up this new window. Optionally, we can write the EL to a text file. The information will still be 'attached' to this EEGset, but that text file can be useful for examining outside Matlab.

#### Stick to numeric events - not strings
Note that the EventList does not like strings. Event names are best to be numbers and not text. If your event names are text, we suggest converting them to a numeric code here. The events here are all numbers, but stored as stings for now. Using the 'Create numeric equivilent' option in the 'Create EventList' GUI, the text is dropped from a string event code, leaving the number. This option will trim any text, and convert to numeric type, and so will work for these event codes. If you need to convert different types of string events to numeric, you can use the 'Convert string code' editable option in the middle of this window, but this is not needed for this example dataset.

The boundary code is an important event code, indicating the presence of a discontinuity, like a removed section of data, or a break in the recording. We recommend keeping that in the data with the numeric indicator of event `-99`.

![create_eventlist_window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/84316905-cc1d5900-ab20-11ea-87af-03b534022098.png)
 
After hitting 'CREATE', a new EEG set is created -- same as the previous one, but now with a EventList attached.

Let's save this new EEG set in the S1 folder.

#### Looking at the EventList
Optionally, to inspect this new EL, we can probe

`EEG.EVENTLIST.eventinfo`

or explore there in the Matlab Workspace.

![EEG_EL_struct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5137405/84317286-64b3d900-ab21-11ea-9737-1a0d0ec08fd8.png)


If you chose to write the EventList to a text file, you can also view it in the Matlab editor with something like:
`edit S1/EventList_1.txt`

This shows our events (all 2557 of them), and the time that they occurred.

Note that at the moment, the code field is filled, and that the binlabel field is empty.
